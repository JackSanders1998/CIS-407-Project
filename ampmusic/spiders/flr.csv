Working with the U.S. State Department and under their own non-profit Bluegrass Ambassadors, the band incorporates music from Africa, Asia, the Middle East and more into their already robust repertoire of unique traditional American music. When performing live, presenting workshops and wherever they are, the Henhouse Prowlers find and spread the commonality we share as human beings through the universal language of music. On stage, the group's electrifying performances give audiences a sense of how much they love what they do; while on record, the band manages to explore their collective life experiences through songwriting and intricate instrumentation. While bluegrass is the undeniable foundation of the Henhouse Prowlers's music, the band manages to bend and squeeze the traditional form into a sound all their own. With over 175 shows a year, the quartet often performs in places traditional American music has never been. Tours in Siberia or the Middle East are not uncommon since the Henhouse Prowlers started working as cultural ambassadors with the U.S. State Department in 2013 on the American Music Abroad cultural diplomacy tours. These global experiences have pushed the band in new directions musically, with songs from Africa and Asia on several albums, but they have also moved the group to start an educational outreach program for school children and festival-goers alike.  The Henhouse Prowlers's non-profit Bluegrass Ambassadors uses traditional American music as an educational foundation to connect folk music and cultures all over the world. Having been to 11 countries in Africa alongside Russia, Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan, Saudi Arabia and UAE, these powerful direct experiences with distant peoples and musicians have shaped the band’s worldview and shifted the group’s direction towards bridging cultural gaps through music, educational programs and workshops. The Henhouse Prowlers released two albums in 2017, including   in March and the phenomenal studio album   in November. 2018-19 saw more European tours for the band and even more adventures as the Henhouse Prowlers continue to bring their own blend of bluegrass.

 Nashville based husband and wife duo Cloverdayle originally hail from the Pacific Northwest. Since the birth of Cloverdayle in 2008, Chad and Rachel Hamar have had a relentless determination to bring their brand of country music to the masses in a grassroots way. The duo moved from their home state of Oregon to Nashville, Tenn., in the fall of 2013. Not in search of fame, fortune or record deals, but with one overriding goal - to push themselves as songwriters. So they've written, and lived, and toured, and written, and lived, and toured, and written some more. Pulling from those real life experiences, Chad and Rachel have literally been writing and performing the soundtrack of their lives...and their friends' lives...and perfect strangers' lives. Cut to five years post-move, with two fully-fan-funded albums & two EPs under their collective belts, a featured song
on the popular Canadian TV show “Heartland” (now on Netflix), a feature on  's website, hundreds of
energy-fueled live performances, (including opening spots for Kenny Chesney, Lady Antebellum, Eric Church,
Jason Aldean and Kelsea Ballerini), and thousands of late nights and copious cups of early morning coffee, Cloverdayle then released a self-titled full length album featuring 15 original songs penned or co-penned by the duo, as well as a bonus track of their take on the 1996 hit “Strawberry Wine.” Their engaging live shows and regular hilarity - via Facebook and Instagram Live stream outlets - sparked the duo’s
fan base to fund their most recent Kickstarter campaign that reached almost $37,000 in just 30 days. In addition to many high-profile shows on their 2018 “Summer of Shenanigans Tour,” Cloverdayle was invited to join the line-up at the iconic Oregon Jamboree, headlining the second stage in the coveted Saturday night spot
and performing directly in front of Maren Morris and Brett Eldredge on the main stage. And Nashville is taking notice. After being pitted against prominent groups like Maddie & Tae and Runaway June, Cloverdayle wrapped up their biggest year yet by being named Women of Country’s 2018 “Group of the Year”.
