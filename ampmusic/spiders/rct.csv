His music is best described as ''Bluesy Folk & Roll with Jazz Attitude'' and his guitar playing and singing as ''Berklee College of Caveman''. He has long been regarded as one of the west coast's hardest working (as many as 379 performances in one year) and prolific artists. He's an ''Iron Man Of The Road''. Mick was born the son of a rocket scientist in Ohio and followed the aerospace boom to California at age two. His earliest musical influences were listening to Tchaikovsky's ''1812 Overture'' and Chet Atkins as well as the Kingston Trio and Cannonball Adderly. His first published work was an early 60's Haiku entitled ''Fireflies'' in the Fullerton Daily News Tribune. Overman abandoned guitar lessons in fourth grade for little league baseball after learning ''These Boots Are Made For Walkin''' and began studying drums at age 13. Overman resumed study of the guitar around age 14 and became interested in songwriting. He became the youngest city commissioner in his hometown at age 17 when he was appointed by the Fullerton City Council to serve as youth delegate to the Human Relations Commission. After completing high school in 3 years to get a head start on dropping out of college Mick studied music privately with his friend Marty Headman who had graduated from Boston's Berklee College of Music on the Dean's list with a degree in composing and arranging. Overman and Headman together with John Seth Sherman formed the bands ''Crosscurrent'' in Ashland Oregon and ''Caledonia'' in Missoula Montana and returned to California in 1981 to form the first version of ''Mick Overman & the Maniacs''. Overman moved to Santa Cruz County in the Spring of 1986 with Jeanie Golino who was pregnant with their daughter Corina who was born in September of 1986. They settled in La Selva Beach (south Santa Cruz County) CA in early 1987. Mick lived in a yellow house with a white fence ''between the ghetto and the farm'' near Freedom CA (this was the location of ''The Cave'') from 1990 until 2004. He formed Max Records and released ''Empty City'' in 1994 and ''Lucky.'' in 1996 and the all acoustic ''Mileage'' in 1998. After performing and touring nonstop for 12 years Overman chose to detach from the business end of the music business at the dawn of the 21st Century for his artistic and spiritual and physical health. One of the many positive results of this sabbatical was the writing and recording of his 4th cd ''Authentic'' which was released in early 2002 and received considerable national radio airplay. He also studied and trained at the Berkeley Psychic Institute in Berkeley CA during this period. Mick moved to Portland OR in early 2004. Overman wrote the songs he contributed to his 5th cd ''Mick Overman & The Maniacs - Good Thing Happen'' in 2004 and 2005. Much of this work was done in ''The New Cave'' which is located in the basement of his Portland OR home. ''Good Thing Happen'' was produced and recorded and mixed with the help of his band ''Mick Overman & The Maniacs'' and Cookie Marenco at her OTR Studios in Belmont CA in late 2005 and early 2006 and was released nationally in February of 2007. Mick's new all acoustic and 6th release ""Mister Double Happiness"" (also produced by Cookie Marenco at OTR) is here. Radio and press copies are available upon request.

Portland from Albuquerque, New Mexico, he's been included on shows and

Sister.  Recently, though, Lewi has taken all the things he learned from
working with these fine performers and has been spending his time leading a
roots rock/americana band of his own, singing his own compositions. This group
owes much to the American tradition of good songs played with high energy, deep
roots, and an unpretentious sense of fun. Their sound finds the connection
between the basement feel of The Band, the raspy blue-eyed soul of Joe Cocker,
the desert space of Giant Sand, the ""without a net"" deep space
improvisations of the San Francisco ballrooms, the punk abandon of The Stooges
and the quiet contemplation of Neil Young playing solo. Helping achieve this are THE LEFT COAST ROASTERS, a band of
stalwart Portland musicians. Bill Rudolph (bass and vocals) played with the
Crackpots and Little Sue for years, driving their home crowd into an energetic
frenzy with his low tones. Ned Folkerth (drums) has toured the world over with
many groups, including the midwest's Pinetop Seven and Portland's own Caleb
Klauder Band, always laying down the perfect groove to cure whatever ails ya.

But the Gunfight doesn't lay claim to being a blues, country or gospel act ... they're really just a rock band. The band's instinctive ability to play seamlessly together is perhaps one of the first things to impress, and betrays the band's experience: Mexican Gunfight's personnel have wandered the U.S. tour routes together for nearly a quarter century, in a half-dozen different outfits, thousands of shows and in hundreds of venues (not to mention a variety of interesting vehicles). Perhaps most notably, their incarnation as The Renegade Saints got regional acclaim and national attention back in the early '90s, but even then they were too rockin' to be a jam band, and definitely too free-form to be grunge. Since that time the members of Mexican Gunfight -- individually and collectively -- have been notable fixtures in the NW music scene; there's a high probability that you have seen at least one of them playing at a bar, club, theater or festival over the last several years.     The Gunfight pays homage to acts as diverse as Neil Young, Hothouse Flowers, Willie Nelson, Santana, Glen Campbell and Little Feat while offering just as much stylistic variety in its originals. They borrow songs from their ""ancestral"" incarnations, including the Saints but also Kerosene Dream, The Strangers, Dixon, Tremor Guild and Nine Days Wonder. (Bassist Dave Coey -- a prolific songster in all of his bands since the '80s -- has recently popped out a few new tunes that the band quickly worked over live a few times and brought into the studio.) The spirit behind Mexican Gunfight's music is - simply put - to consider everything fair game and have a blast rocking it up. ","East, Blues, Country, Jazz, Latin, Pop, Soul, Rock",0

The Brothers Jam is an American Band with a plan: to entertain audiences and wring beauty from any song that crosses their path. The Brothers are six individuals who have found common ground in the creation of music that thrives on the deep connections that come from over 20 years of collectively surrendering to the song. Audiences have found community in the Brothers, asking them to play weddings, parties, galas, fund raisers, creative events... anywhere joy is at a premium and love, imagination and good vibes are in the air. They have an unbridled energy, and they seek to never play any song the same way twice. They are the epitome of what a jam band must be to deliver. And deliver they have been doing for over twenty years, and will do so the next time you see them. Anchored by brothers Jamey and David Hampton, musical messengers together since their teens in the 70's, the Brothers Jam includes original drummer and veteran of bands too numerous to name, Lou Lozada. He is the heartbeat of the band, the fuel in the steam engine, the true north of the collective brotherly compass. Dick Shoemaker stands up to the mic, sax in hand, and conjures up a conglom of the Big Man Clemons, Coltrane and Desmond, with a funky soul all his own. On keys, James Peale brings a loose vibe reminiscent of Nicky Hopkins to the Jam, with a vocal style that would do Pigpen proud. Dave Rosenberg is the soup stock in this gumbo, holding it all together on bass with his Berkeley-trained chops and his singular positive approach... all smiles in the midst of even the deepest jams. This then is the Brothers Jam: Beauty, fire, passion, freedom, soul. Check it out. ","Soul, Rock",0

the desert space of Giant Sand, the ""without a net"" deep space
improvisations of the San Francisco ballrooms, the punk abandon of The Stooges
and the quiet contemplation of Neil Young playing solo. Helping achieve this are THE LEFT COAST ROASTERS, a band of
stalwart Portland musicians. Bill Rudolph (bass and vocals) played with the
Crackpots and Little Sue for years, driving their home crowd into an energetic
frenzy with his low tones. Ned Folkerth (drums) has toured the world over with
many groups, including the midwest's Pinetop Seven and Portland's own Caleb
Klauder Band, always laying down the perfect groove to cure whatever ails ya.
Newest addition Dan Eccles (guitar) has most often been seen in the band
Richmond Fontaine or backing up local rock legend Fernando. ","Country, Folk, Soul, Rock",0

songwriting comes from the heart, telling both autobiographical and fictional
accounts of a man who emerged from a battered beginning and fought internally

his right to sing the blues, and he can wail with the best of them. Then in the

But the Gunfight doesn't lay claim to being a blues, country or gospel act ... they're really just a rock band. The band's instinctive ability to play seamlessly together is perhaps one of the first things to impress, and betrays the band's experience: Mexican Gunfight's personnel have wandered the U.S. tour routes together for nearly a quarter century, in a half-dozen different outfits, thousands of shows and in hundreds of venues (not to mention a variety of interesting vehicles). Perhaps most notably, their incarnation as The Renegade Saints got regional acclaim and national attention back in the early '90s, but even then they were too rockin' to be a jam band, and definitely too free-form to be grunge. Since that time the members of Mexican Gunfight -- individually and collectively -- have been notable fixtures in the NW music scene; there's a high probability that you have seen at least one of them playing at a bar, club, theater or festival over the last several years.     The Gunfight pays homage to acts as diverse as Neil Young, Hothouse Flowers, Willie Nelson, Santana, Glen Campbell and Little Feat while offering just as much stylistic variety in its originals. They borrow songs from their ""ancestral"" incarnations, including the Saints but also Kerosene Dream, The Strangers, Dixon, Tremor Guild and Nine Days Wonder. (Bassist Dave Coey -- a prolific songster in all of his bands since the '80s -- has recently popped out a few new tunes that the band quickly worked over live a few times and brought into the studio.) The spirit behind Mexican Gunfight's music is - simply put - to consider everything fair game and have a blast rocking it up. ","East, Blues, Country, Jazz, Latin, Pop, Soul, Rock",0

Irish harp, North Indian sarod, Greek bouzouki, Middle Eastern and African percussion, Irish and Appalachian fiddle, folk guitar and harmony vocals--no one has ever been able to reach a final tally on just how many instruments Elizabeth Nicholson and Bob Soper play, or how many cultures influence their music. Duo partners for seven years, they also share the dual role of fronting the critically acclaimed international roots quintet Stringed Migration. Their music has been hailed as ""performed with the sort of resonance that separates masters from neophytes"" (Jerome Clark, rambles.net, 2009), and has been featured on NPR's The Thistle and Shamrock, The Midnight Special, and hundreds of other radio programs worldwide.  Considered among the top American interpreters of Irish traditional music for harp, Elizabeth Nicholson's harp studies have also included classical, Paraguayan, and medieval music, and she has stretched the traditional boundaries of the instrument into rock music and country blues. Her 2006 CD of traditional and original music,  was released to widespread critical praise and international airplay, and was chosen ""Folk Album of the Month"" on Iowa Public Radio. Bob Soper is counted among Portland's most astonishingly versatile multi-instrumentalists. A rock and jazz drummer from a young age who also studied classical Indian music at the Ali Akbar College, he went on to learn the Irish fiddle, ultimately becoming one the Northwest's most sought-after players. Also an accomplished guitarist, bouzouki player and vocalist, he's been a member of some of the region's most beloved and successful ensembles, including the Irish bands C'l an T' and Grafton Street, as well as the old-time/country-blues group The Pagan Jug Band.
