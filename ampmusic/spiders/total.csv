Mountain is a Portland-based duo that combines percussion, guitar, and an
affinity for vocal harmony to create a unique brand of pop with intricate,
world-music-influenced arrangements.  The band's subtly virtuosic style
has been compared in print to current acts like The Dirty Projectors and Avett
Brothers and classics like Paul Simon's  , but it is
perhaps more telling that reviewers have tried to peg the duo's musical
influences in genres ranging from jazz to folk, classical to psychedelic rock,
and world music to doom metal (all are correct!).  Kali and Matt usually
just call it ""pop with a short attention span"".

drums and percussive instruments, and Matt animates his acoustic guitar using
nimble fingers and a bunch of carefully chosen effect pedals.  African

He carries on that tradition here. Ed Haynes wrote his first song at age thirteen,
shortly after his mother bought him his first guitar. The song he wrote was
terrible. I mean real awful. Unfazed, however, by the melodic deficiencies and
the blatant self-aggrandizing nature of his lyrics, he kept at it. He began
writing better and better songs.  After moving to San Francisco as an emotionally
immature young man, he broke into an unoccupied recording studio in the wee
hours one morning and recorded, very quietly, a handful of his own compositions.
That simple tape of him - alone hunched over a guitar and practically
whispering into the microphone for fear of alerting the police - landed him a
recording contract. His debut album Ed Haynes sings Ed Haynes was released. The
album featured the college-radio anthem I Want to Kill Everybody, which reached
out and touched a generation of un-snapped loners. The video of the song became
an all-too-brief staple on MTV. People Magazine declared Ed ""extremely
interesting"", a comment that Ed described as ""somewhat
interesting"".  In support of his album, Ed toured nationally,
and made sojourns into Canada and England as well. Some of the clubs that have
been proud (author's interpretation) to present Ed Haynes include: Tipatina's
in New Orleans, The Bottom Line in New York, The Hammersmith Odeon in London,
and The Great American Music Hall in San Francisco.  Following this initial success Ed Haynes rested
on his laurels. His friends, family, and colleagues all told him ""Ed,
don't rest on your laurels! Don't rest on your laurels!"" Ed, however, much
to his credit, lumped this and all other kernels of free advice he received
into the ""actively ignore file"" and remained a determined follower of
his own, sometimes bizarre predilections.  He hobnobbed with celebrities, famous
politicians, rouge lawyers, and jaded journalists. He beat the crap out of
Norman Mailer and Mickey Rourke at the same time in Malibu, CA. in what would
later be dubbed the ""Nitrous-oxide Incident."" He re-enrolled at San
Francisco State University to finish up his degree in Sandblasting that he had
begun years before. He tried to launch a golfball-swallowing craze.  But what of his early formative years? Ed was
born and raised just outside Washington D.C. in Northern Virginia. He vividly
remembers sitting at the picnic tables at the public swimming pool eating
Sweet-tarts and Red-Hots when Richard Nixon announced his resignation in 1974.
Did growing up just outside the Beltway during the turbulent and tumultuous
early 70's have a profound influence on young Ed, and help shape him into the
kind of songwriter and social critic that he is today? ""No"" says Ed,
staring vacantly into space.  Even through the rocky unstable periods of his
personal life, however, Ed Haynes has continued to write songs. Mining the vast
resources of his personal experiences, and borrowing the personal experiences
of others (with or without their permission), Ed is never at a loss for subject
matter to write about. His mantra for many years has been ""There have always
been the songs, and there will always be the songs."" He can be heard
repeating this mantra over and over, sometimes in a low barely audible mutter,
and other times in loud shrieking banshee-like wails.  Now, with the release of his new album Snacking
with a Vengeance, Ed's truly is a rags-to-riches story, only set to music.
Except that he never really was in rags, being brought up quite comfortably in
a middle-class suburb. And technically speaking, he isn't actually rich.
There's no Family Money. Frankly, he'll be lucky if there's any inheritance at
all considering the way his retired parents have been painting the town red.
They're on a fixed income for gosh sakes! But it's a rags-to-riches story all
the same. At the beginning he sucked. But he worked hard and it has paid off
for him. I think we all can learn something from the Ed Haynes saga and apply
it to our own lives. I know I will. But first I think we should all listen to

 Nashville based husband and wife duo Cloverdayle originally hail from the Pacific Northwest. Since the birth of Cloverdayle in 2008, Chad and Rachel Hamar have had a relentless determination to bring their brand of country music to the masses in a grassroots way. The duo moved from their home state of Oregon to Nashville, Tenn., in the fall of 2013. Not in search of fame, fortune or record deals, but with one overriding goal - to push themselves as songwriters. So they've written, and lived, and toured, and written, and lived, and toured, and written some more. Pulling from those real life experiences, Chad and Rachel have literally been writing and performing the soundtrack of their lives...and their friends' lives...and perfect strangers' lives. Cut to five years post-move, with two fully-fan-funded albums & two EPs under their collective belts, a featured song
on the popular Canadian TV show “Heartland” (now on Netflix), a feature on  's website, hundreds of
energy-fueled live performances, (including opening spots for Kenny Chesney, Lady Antebellum, Eric Church,
Jason Aldean and Kelsea Ballerini), and thousands of late nights and copious cups of early morning coffee, Cloverdayle then released a self-titled full length album featuring 15 original songs penned or co-penned by the duo, as well as a bonus track of their take on the 1996 hit “Strawberry Wine.” Their engaging live shows and regular hilarity - via Facebook and Instagram Live stream outlets - sparked the duo’s
fan base to fund their most recent Kickstarter campaign that reached almost $37,000 in just 30 days. In addition to many high-profile shows on their 2018 “Summer of Shenanigans Tour,” Cloverdayle was invited to join the line-up at the iconic Oregon Jamboree, headlining the second stage in the coveted Saturday night spot
and performing directly in front of Maren Morris and Brett Eldredge on the main stage. And Nashville is taking notice. After being pitted against prominent groups like Maddie & Tae and Runaway June, Cloverdayle wrapped up their biggest year yet by being named Women of Country’s 2018 “Group of the Year”. Born in Colorado with roots across Wyoming and settled in Oregon, it’s been a long time

Working with the U.S. State Department and under their own non-profit Bluegrass Ambassadors, the band incorporates music from Africa, Asia, the Middle East and more into their already robust repertoire of unique traditional American music. When performing live, presenting workshops and wherever they are, the Henhouse Prowlers find and spread the commonality we share as human beings through the universal language of music. On stage, the group's electrifying performances give audiences a sense of how much they love what they do; while on record, the band manages to explore their collective life experiences through songwriting and intricate instrumentation. While bluegrass is the undeniable foundation of the Henhouse Prowlers's music, the band manages to bend and squeeze the traditional form into a sound all their own. With over 175 shows a year, the quartet often performs in places traditional American music has never been. Tours in Siberia or the Middle East are not uncommon since the Henhouse Prowlers started working as cultural ambassadors with the U.S. State Department in 2013 on the American Music Abroad cultural diplomacy tours. These global experiences have pushed the band in new directions musically, with songs from Africa and Asia on several albums, but they have also moved the group to start an educational outreach program for school children and festival-goers alike.  The Henhouse Prowlers's non-profit Bluegrass Ambassadors uses traditional American music as an educational foundation to connect folk music and cultures all over the world. Having been to 11 countries in Africa alongside Russia, Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan, Saudi Arabia and UAE, these powerful direct experiences with distant peoples and musicians have shaped the band’s worldview and shifted the group’s direction towards bridging cultural gaps through music, educational programs and workshops. The Henhouse Prowlers released two albums in 2017, including   in March and the phenomenal studio album   in November. 2018-19 saw more European tours for the band and even more adventures as the Henhouse Prowlers continue to bring their own blend of bluegrass.

That said, DJs at Portland radio station Kink FM, which has three of its tracks in rotation, have described Hourglass as a feel-good album, the tunefully acoustic sort you might add to a road-trip playlist or queue up for a lazy Sunday afternoon. Fans of Jack Johnson, Bob Dylan and Mumford and Sons may find a kindred spirit in Botsford, who began playing piano as a 5 year old before switching to the Taylor acoustic guitar his dad gave him at age 14. (""That guitar has been anywhere and everywhere with me,"" he says. ""Thousands of shows and hours of practice time. Still plays beautifully."") Inspired by vintage singer-songwriters including Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan and Van Morrison, as well as his grandfather, a big-band pianist, Botsford began to hone his country/folk/pop hybrid style as a teen. From braving finger-numbing temperatures busking outside Starbucks after midnight to logging up to 300 solo shows a year for the last five years, Botsford's dream of a professional musical career has gradually become rooted in reality. As a solo artist, Botsford is a veteran of American Idol rounds in Portland and in Kansas City. In 2010, he released the EP Pearl; in 2015, he landed one of two finalist spots in the Aloft Hotels' Project Aloft online songwriting contest, which attracted nearly 1,000 entrants and was judged by producers from Nashville and L.A. Botsford's prize included a mentoring session and opening slot with Ingrid Michaelson in New York, with a 25-city solo tour to follow in 2016. Shortly after that victory, he was booked as an opener for Napa's Live in the Vineyard show on a bill with acts including The Barenaked Ladies and Spearhead's Michael Franti. Performing is an escape for Botsford: ‘Whenever I'm playing, I'm not stressing or worrying, I'm just in the moment,"" he says. That release, and seeing people's faces light up when they recognize a song, keep his love for playing strong. (Offstage, he recharges by camping, hiking and horseback riding. ""There's something to be said for just getting away, whether it's nature or whether it's being alone,"" he says.) Although he often plays solo, he likes gigging with other musicians, too, from a trio to a full-scale band. His goal is to get his music out to a wider national audience, to tour and record, and to leave listeners with lyrics -- stitched together from his own experiences as well as stories he's heard -- stuck in their heads. ""I feel like people can expect to feel something,"" he says of his music. ""They'll find at least one song that will match where they've been or where they're coming from.

His earliest musical influences were listening to Tchaikovsky's ''1812 Overture'' and Chet Atkins as well as the Kingston Trio and Cannonball Adderly. His first published work was an early 60's Haiku entitled ''Fireflies'' in the Fullerton Daily News Tribune. Overman abandoned guitar lessons in fourth grade for little league baseball after learning ''These Boots Are Made For Walkin''' and began studying drums at age 13. Overman resumed study of the guitar around age 14 and became interested in songwriting. He became the youngest city commissioner in his hometown at age 17 when he was appointed by the Fullerton City Council to serve as youth delegate to the Human Relations Commission. After completing high school in 3 years to get a head start on dropping out of college Mick studied music privately with his friend Marty Headman who had graduated from Boston's Berklee College of Music on the Dean's list with a degree in composing and arranging. Overman and Headman together with John Seth Sherman formed the bands ''Crosscurrent'' in Ashland Oregon and ''Caledonia'' in Missoula Montana and returned to California in 1981 to form the first version of ''Mick Overman & the Maniacs''. Overman moved to Santa Cruz County in the Spring of 1986 with Jeanie Golino who was pregnant with their daughter Corina who was born in September of 1986. They settled in La Selva Beach (south Santa Cruz County) CA in early 1987. Mick lived in a yellow house with a white fence ''between the ghetto and the farm'' near Freedom CA (this was the location of ''The Cave'') from 1990 until 2004. He formed Max Records and released ''Empty City'' in 1994 and ''Lucky.'' in 1996 and the all acoustic ''Mileage'' in 1998. After performing and touring nonstop for 12 years Overman chose to detach from the business end of the music business at the dawn of the 21st Century for his artistic and spiritual and physical health. One of the many positive results of this sabbatical was the writing and recording of his 4th cd ''Authentic'' which was released in early 2002 and received considerable national radio airplay. He also studied and trained at the Berkeley Psychic Institute in Berkeley CA during this period. Mick moved to Portland OR in early 2004. Overman wrote the songs he contributed to his 5th cd ''Mick Overman & The Maniacs - Good Thing Happen'' in 2004 and 2005. Much of this work was done in ''The New Cave'' which is located in the basement of his Portland OR home. ''Good Thing Happen'' was produced and recorded and mixed with the help of his band ''Mick Overman & The Maniacs'' and Cookie Marenco at her OTR Studios in Belmont CA in late 2005 and early 2006 and was released nationally in February of 2007. Mick's new all acoustic and 6th release ""Mister Double Happiness"" (also produced by Cookie Marenco at OTR) is here. Radio and press copies are available upon request.

The Brothers Jam is an American Band with a plan: to entertain audiences and wring beauty from any song that crosses their path. The Brothers are six individuals who have found common ground in the creation of music that thrives on the deep connections that come from over 20 years of collectively surrendering to the song. Audiences have found community in the Brothers, asking them to play weddings, parties, galas, fund raisers, creative events... anywhere joy is at a premium and love, imagination and good vibes are in the air. They have an unbridled energy, and they seek to never play any song the same way twice. They are the epitome of what a jam band must be to deliver. And deliver they have been doing for over twenty years, and will do so the next time you see them. Anchored by brothers Jamey and David Hampton, musical messengers together since their teens in the 70's, the Brothers Jam includes original drummer and veteran of bands too numerous to name, Lou Lozada. He is the heartbeat of the band, the fuel in the steam engine, the true north of the collective brotherly compass. Dick Shoemaker stands up to the mic, sax in hand, and conjures up a conglom of the Big Man Clemons, Coltrane and Desmond, with a funky soul all his own. On keys, James Peale brings a loose vibe reminiscent of Nicky Hopkins to the Jam, with a vocal style that would do Pigpen proud. Dave Rosenberg is the soup stock in this gumbo, holding it all together on bass with his Berkeley-trained chops and his singular positive approach... all smiles in the midst of even the deepest jams. This then is the Brothers Jam: Beauty, fire, passion, freedom, soul. Check it out. ","Soul, Rock",0

Portland from Albuquerque, New Mexico, he's been included on shows and

Sister.  Recently, though, Lewi has taken all the things he learned from
working with these fine performers and has been spending his time leading a
roots rock/americana band of his own, singing his own compositions. This group
owes much to the American tradition of good songs played with high energy, deep
roots, and an unpretentious sense of fun. Their sound finds the connection
between the basement feel of The Band, the raspy blue-eyed soul of Joe Cocker,
the desert space of Giant Sand, the ""without a net"" deep space
improvisations of the San Francisco ballrooms, the punk abandon of The Stooges
and the quiet contemplation of Neil Young playing solo. Helping achieve this are THE LEFT COAST ROASTERS, a band of
stalwart Portland musicians. Bill Rudolph (bass and vocals) played with the
Crackpots and Little Sue for years, driving their home crowd into an energetic
frenzy with his low tones. Ned Folkerth (drums) has toured the world over with
many groups, including the midwest's Pinetop Seven and Portland's own Caleb
Klauder Band, always laying down the perfect groove to cure whatever ails ya.

But the Gunfight doesn't lay claim to being a blues, country or gospel act ... they're really just a rock band. The band's instinctive ability to play seamlessly together is perhaps one of the first things to impress, and betrays the band's experience: Mexican Gunfight's personnel have wandered the U.S. tour routes together for nearly a quarter century, in a half-dozen different outfits, thousands of shows and in hundreds of venues (not to mention a variety of interesting vehicles). Perhaps most notably, their incarnation as The Renegade Saints got regional acclaim and national attention back in the early '90s, but even then they were too rockin' to be a jam band, and definitely too free-form to be grunge. Since that time the members of Mexican Gunfight -- individually and collectively -- have been notable fixtures in the NW music scene; there's a high probability that you have seen at least one of them playing at a bar, club, theater or festival over the last several years.     The Gunfight pays homage to acts as diverse as Neil Young, Hothouse Flowers, Willie Nelson, Santana, Glen Campbell and Little Feat while offering just as much stylistic variety in its originals. They borrow songs from their ""ancestral"" incarnations, including the Saints but also Kerosene Dream, The Strangers, Dixon, Tremor Guild and Nine Days Wonder. (Bassist Dave Coey -- a prolific songster in all of his bands since the '80s -- has recently popped out a few new tunes that the band quickly worked over live a few times and brought into the studio.) The spirit behind Mexican Gunfight's music is - simply put - to consider everything fair game and have a blast rocking it up. ","East, Blues, Country, Jazz, Latin, Pop, Soul, Rock",0

He started playing professionally at teen dances and parties at the age of fourteen. By the age of eighteen, he was sneaking into the blues clubs of Chicago to hear such greats as Muddy Waters, Junior Wells, Buddy Guy, and James Cotton. Over the next ten years, he would work as a guitarist for Junior Wells, Big Time Sarah, and Detroit Junior. In the mid '70s, he formed his first band, Skid City Blues Band, which featured Billy as singer, guitarist, and songwriter. After fifteen years of touring the midwest, Billy moved to Los Angeles in 1988. He spent that year studying with Blues great Tony Matthews, guitarist for Little Richard and Ray Charles and spent half of the next year playing behind, Don ""Sugar Cane"" Harris, perhaps the world's greatest blues violinist. Los Angeles is where he truly started focusing on writing his own material. In the mid '90s, Billy moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico and began playing his original songs at local clubs and concerts to great acclaim. Within the next year, Billy D and the Hoodoos had formed. In August of 2002, with the help of some of the best musicians in New Mexico, he released his first CD,   from his first release was voted the number one song by a regional artist, at KTAO,the world's largest solar powered radio station. KTAO hosted the Annual Solar Fest in New Mexico where Billy D and the HooDoos appeared that year, opening for Los Lonely Boys and Robert Cray. , and several more successful years in New Mexico, Billy left the Southwest for the Northwest, arriving in Oregon around Christmas 2009. He released his newest CD ""Somethin's Wrong,"" which was embraced by the Portland music community and received outstanding reviews. ...this fine collection alternates between soulful blues ballads (""Somethin's Wrong,"" ""Blue,"" and ""Love Makes You Cry"") and gritty slide guitar rave-ups such as the Thorogoodesque ""50,"" and the stomper, ""Crazy Little Dancin' Queen."" --P. Vaughn Shaver ""Many of the songs draw upon that gut-bucket punch that makes your body want to groove (""Crazy Little Dancin' Queen,"" ""Charlene""), ballads that can make you tear up, (""Blue,"" ""Love Makes You Cry""), swampy-sounding slide (""50""), or numbers that could easily cross over and find favor between blues and rock genres (""Miss The Love,"" ""Save My Life""). --Greg Johnson, president of the Cascade Blues Association in ""The blues are steeped in tradition and, in many cases, arbitrary song structure. Rarely do blues-types successfully deviate from the formula with original material. But Billy D (Billy Desmond) not only pulls it off, but may have unknowingly created his own genre."" --Archer, Production DIrector, KINK.FM ","Blues, Country, Soul, Rock",0

But the Gunfight doesn't lay claim to being a blues, country or gospel act ... they're really just a rock band. The band's instinctive ability to play seamlessly together is perhaps one of the first things to impress, and betrays the band's experience: Mexican Gunfight's personnel have wandered the U.S. tour routes together for nearly a quarter century, in a half-dozen different outfits, thousands of shows and in hundreds of venues (not to mention a variety of interesting vehicles). Perhaps most notably, their incarnation as The Renegade Saints got regional acclaim and national attention back in the early '90s, but even then they were too rockin' to be a jam band, and definitely too free-form to be grunge. Since that time the members of Mexican Gunfight -- individually and collectively -- have been notable fixtures in the NW music scene; there's a high probability that you have seen at least one of them playing at a bar, club, theater or festival over the last several years.     The Gunfight pays homage to acts as diverse as Neil Young, Hothouse Flowers, Willie Nelson, Santana, Glen Campbell and Little Feat while offering just as much stylistic variety in its originals. They borrow songs from their ""ancestral"" incarnations, including the Saints but also Kerosene Dream, The Strangers, Dixon, Tremor Guild and Nine Days Wonder. (Bassist Dave Coey -- a prolific songster in all of his bands since the '80s -- has recently popped out a few new tunes that the band quickly worked over live a few times and brought into the studio.) The spirit behind Mexican Gunfight's music is - simply put - to consider everything fair game and have a blast rocking it up. ","East, Blues, Country, Jazz, Latin, Pop, Soul, Rock",0

 Nashville based husband and wife duo Cloverdayle originally hail from the Pacific Northwest. Since the birth of Cloverdayle in 2008, Chad and Rachel Hamar have had a relentless determination to bring their brand of country music to the masses in a grassroots way. The duo moved from their home state of Oregon to Nashville, Tenn., in the fall of 2013. Not in search of fame, fortune or record deals, but with one overriding goal - to push themselves as songwriters. So they've written, and lived, and toured, and written, and lived, and toured, and written some more. Pulling from those real life experiences, Chad and Rachel have literally been writing and performing the soundtrack of their lives...and their friends' lives...and perfect strangers' lives. Cut to five years post-move, with two fully-fan-funded albums & two EPs under their collective belts, a featured song
on the popular Canadian TV show “Heartland” (now on Netflix), a feature on  's website, hundreds of
energy-fueled live performances, (including opening spots for Kenny Chesney, Lady Antebellum, Eric Church,
Jason Aldean and Kelsea Ballerini), and thousands of late nights and copious cups of early morning coffee, Cloverdayle then released a self-titled full length album featuring 15 original songs penned or co-penned by the duo, as well as a bonus track of their take on the 1996 hit “Strawberry Wine.” Their engaging live shows and regular hilarity - via Facebook and Instagram Live stream outlets - sparked the duo’s
fan base to fund their most recent Kickstarter campaign that reached almost $37,000 in just 30 days. In addition to many high-profile shows on their 2018 “Summer of Shenanigans Tour,” Cloverdayle was invited to join the line-up at the iconic Oregon Jamboree, headlining the second stage in the coveted Saturday night spot
and performing directly in front of Maren Morris and Brett Eldredge on the main stage. And Nashville is taking notice. After being pitted against prominent groups like Maddie & Tae and Runaway June, Cloverdayle wrapped up their biggest year yet by being named Women of Country’s 2018 “Group of the Year”. Born in Colorado with roots across Wyoming and settled in Oregon, it’s been a long time
coming home for Adam Larson & Co. - playing music all across the States from smoky bars,
and dance halls, to packed festivals! Larson has been writing and performing shows solo as well as with a bluegrass band

Filtered through the rose-tinted glasses of psychedelia and power-pop, the music weaves daring horn lines and serpentine guitar riffs through Merseybeat rockers and cheeky sambas. It's an undeniably upbeat, positively danceable affair. The band's origins can be found in Chico, CA with frontman/songwriter Maurice Spencer and his lust for snapping audiences out of their navel-gazing slumber. His background in theater and music journalism was the spring-loaded platform that propelled him from curating song compilations and theatrical composition to an impresario fronting a bonafide live  There's something rare in the grand cacophony of today's musical class: bands that provided a live  Not just a performance, not tuning for two minutes between songs, not offering excuses about why something sounded better in rehearsal the night before kind of affair, but a real   Something that people talk about afterwards; a group that melts faces, that puts on a show and that never forgets the whole purpose is to entertain so that for one short hour people could forget about their long, boring, meaningless hours working at the vape store, the karaoke bar, or the Tatertot Taco cart (which is amazing, everyone should go there...) and have an honest to goodness thing happen.  Every band needs a story. The Maurice and the Stiff Sisters story is that they put on a ripping live show. Sometimes people need to be told it's okay to fucking dance.  From their headquarters in Portland, Oregon, to their rural compound in picturesque Hockinson, Washington, Maurice and the Stiff Sisters add accelerants to the fire, smoke life to its filter and dance through the ashes.  Maurice Spencer - vocals/guitar Aaron Mattison - tenor saxophone Future Historians, Ezra Bell, PWRHAUS, The Yule Logs, Salem Symphony Orchestra ","Pop, Soul, Rock",0

Growing up in the small dairy town of Washougal, Washington, Brown's love for music began as a child, soaking in the classic melodies of The Beatles and Roy Orbison that filled the house. Brown demonstrated a natural rhythm by banging along to the beat whenever music was played. Matt's father, Allen, studied the guitar at an early age, playing his dad's 1948 D-28 Martin. However, at age 14, Allen had to shelve his passion for making music when his dad passed away, forcing him into a caretaking role for his four younger siblings. As an adult, Allen frequently played songs on the old guitar with his son Matt keeping the beat on whatever he could find. Matt's father gave him a drum set for his fourteenth birthday, and a guitar when he left home for college in Seattle, encouraging him to follow in the family musical tradition. During college, Brown fell in love with the guitar, and at the urging of his classmates, started performing at open mic nights, revealing his innate ability as a vocalist.  Brown soon became inspired to write songs and grow his skills as a guitarist. Since that time, Brown has fronted bands, played hundreds of shows, opened for Huey Lewis, recorded albums, and journeyed across the country to Nashville to continue developing his craft of songwriting. Brown's songs are fresh but familiar and tend to move the heart as much as the head and feet. His music grabs the attention of the young and old, while being deeply rooted in timeless soul. There is an authenticity in the words and delivery that create Brown's signature sound. Brown's work ethic as an artist comes from his desire for sharing his songs with whomever will lend him an eager ear. Brown has achieved success as a solo artist and will continue leaving no stone unturned with his first Nashville record and numerous tours throughout the USA and Europe. Brown recently signed with Wally's World for college booking and Rock Ridge Music and Blue Plaid Music for management. Rock Ridge Music will be releasing Brown's first full-length album ""Walk Into The Light"" on July 22.
