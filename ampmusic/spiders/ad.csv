Without so much as saying goodbye to his friends or bothering to pack a bag, Dan boarded a train bound for Siberia and headed east with a child's guitar and journal that quickly filled with songs. At some point in those manic months, Balto was born, in a third-class train car, singing and drinking among strangers, somewhere east of Novosibirsk. Dan came home and tracked those new compositions with a band made up of his closest friends. The recordings became Balto's first album, October's Road.

Over time, Balto transformed from a songwriting vehicle into a rock n roll band - performing a boozy, swaggering style of American music rooted at the intersection of Motown, Big Star, Plastic Ono Band-era Lennon, and Jackson Browne. Their interactive live performances have drawn comparisons to fiery indie rockers My Morning Jacket and Wilco, while Seattle-based curators Artist Home describe Strangers (2017) as ""a tangle of beautiful, messy emotions, wrapped up in a sound that's warmly familiar yet brimming with soul and tiny details that are touched by magic.""

He carries on that tradition here. Ed Haynes wrote his first song at age thirteen,
shortly after his mother bought him his first guitar. The song he wrote was
terrible. I mean real awful. Unfazed, however, by the melodic deficiencies and
the blatant self-aggrandizing nature of his lyrics, he kept at it. He began
writing better and better songs.  After moving to San Francisco as an emotionally
immature young man, he broke into an unoccupied recording studio in the wee
hours one morning and recorded, very quietly, a handful of his own compositions.
That simple tape of him - alone hunched over a guitar and practically
whispering into the microphone for fear of alerting the police - landed him a
recording contract. His debut album Ed Haynes sings Ed Haynes was released. The
album featured the college-radio anthem I Want to Kill Everybody, which reached
out and touched a generation of un-snapped loners. The video of the song became
an all-too-brief staple on MTV. People Magazine declared Ed ""extremely
interesting"", a comment that Ed described as ""somewhat
interesting"".  In support of his album, Ed toured nationally,
and made sojourns into Canada and England as well. Some of the clubs that have
been proud (author's interpretation) to present Ed Haynes include: Tipatina's
in New Orleans, The Bottom Line in New York, The Hammersmith Odeon in London,
and The Great American Music Hall in San Francisco.  Following this initial success Ed Haynes rested
on his laurels. His friends, family, and colleagues all told him ""Ed,
don't rest on your laurels! Don't rest on your laurels!"" Ed, however, much
to his credit, lumped this and all other kernels of free advice he received
into the ""actively ignore file"" and remained a determined follower of
his own, sometimes bizarre predilections.  He hobnobbed with celebrities, famous
politicians, rouge lawyers, and jaded journalists. He beat the crap out of
Norman Mailer and Mickey Rourke at the same time in Malibu, CA. in what would
later be dubbed the ""Nitrous-oxide Incident."" He re-enrolled at San
Francisco State University to finish up his degree in Sandblasting that he had
begun years before. He tried to launch a golfball-swallowing craze.  But what of his early formative years? Ed was
born and raised just outside Washington D.C. in Northern Virginia. He vividly
remembers sitting at the picnic tables at the public swimming pool eating
Sweet-tarts and Red-Hots when Richard Nixon announced his resignation in 1974.
Did growing up just outside the Beltway during the turbulent and tumultuous
early 70's have a profound influence on young Ed, and help shape him into the
kind of songwriter and social critic that he is today? ""No"" says Ed,
staring vacantly into space.  Even through the rocky unstable periods of his
personal life, however, Ed Haynes has continued to write songs. Mining the vast
resources of his personal experiences, and borrowing the personal experiences
of others (with or without their permission), Ed is never at a loss for subject
matter to write about. His mantra for many years has been ""There have always
been the songs, and there will always be the songs."" He can be heard
repeating this mantra over and over, sometimes in a low barely audible mutter,
and other times in loud shrieking banshee-like wails.  Now, with the release of his new album Snacking
with a Vengeance, Ed's truly is a rags-to-riches story, only set to music.
Except that he never really was in rags, being brought up quite comfortably in
a middle-class suburb. And technically speaking, he isn't actually rich.
There's no Family Money. Frankly, he'll be lucky if there's any inheritance at
all considering the way his retired parents have been painting the town red.
They're on a fixed income for gosh sakes! But it's a rags-to-riches story all
the same. At the beginning he sucked. But he worked hard and it has paid off
for him. I think we all can learn something from the Ed Haynes saga and apply
it to our own lives. I know I will. But first I think we should all listen to

 Pretty Gritty might be another duo emerging from a sea of female/male acts as of late, but there is nothing typical about these two. Sarah and Blaine have cultivated a sound that is both timeless and classic, yet they still succeed in bringing something fresh to the table, pushing rootsy-Americana sounds into an edgy, alternative space. These two have carved out a reputation as a must-see live act, allowing them to open for such acts as The Wood Brothers (SalmonFest 2016), Michael Franti & Spearhead (SalmonFest 2018), Chris Eldridge, Tim O'Brian, Tony Trischka (Charm City Folk & Bluegrass Festival 2013), Rod Picott, Lake Street Dive, Ben Sollee & the Kentucky Native and Joe Newberry. Both members utilize their multi-instrumental skills to sing, play stringed instruments and hold down back-beats, all simultaneously for a truly engaging experience. But they are not simply just entertainers. It is their mesmerizing vocal harmonies and beautifully crafted songwriting that really tug at the heartstrings and earn them life-long fans. The duo originally formed in Maryland in 2010, but after completing two (completely DIY) national tours, Sarah and Blaine decided to relocate to Portland, Ore. At first they hit the streets, busking downtown, but it didn't take long for folks to take notice. Pretty Gritty are now playing at venues all over the Pacific Northwest. They have successfully completed several tours, covering ground all over Oregon, Washington, Montana, Colorado, Utah and Alaska. Pretty Gritty's self-titled debut album (2012) features the well known jam/festival scene artist, Keller Williams, as the voice of the devil on the track titled ""Hellhound Blues."" This freshman attempt won them two Indie Music Channel awards, Best Country Song and Best Folk Song. In 2015, Pretty Gritty began their relationship with producers Fred Cannon & Paul Buono at Creative & Dreams Music Network (Nashville, Tenn.,) where they recorded their   EP (released February 2016). Pleased with the experience, everyone decided to continue the relationship and return to the studio to record a full album,   which was released in March 2018 and has been receiving rave reviews and radio play across the United States, Canada, the UK and other places throughout Europe. ""There is something simply divine coming out of Portland, Ore., and it's the duo Pretty Gritty. Their release   is a colorful palette of their songwriting and multi-instrumental skills.
