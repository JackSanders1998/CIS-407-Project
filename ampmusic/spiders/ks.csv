Growing up in the small dairy town of Washougal, Washington, Brown's love for music began as a child, soaking in the classic melodies of The Beatles and Roy Orbison that filled the house. Brown demonstrated a natural rhythm by banging along to the beat whenever music was played. Matt's father, Allen, studied the guitar at an early age, playing his dad's 1948 D-28 Martin. However, at age 14, Allen had to shelve his passion for making music when his dad passed away, forcing him into a caretaking role for his four younger siblings. As an adult, Allen frequently played songs on the old guitar with his son Matt keeping the beat on whatever he could find. Matt's father gave him a drum set for his fourteenth birthday, and a guitar when he left home for college in Seattle, encouraging him to follow in the family musical tradition. During college, Brown fell in love with the guitar, and at the urging of his classmates, started performing at open mic nights, revealing his innate ability as a vocalist.  Brown soon became inspired to write songs and grow his skills as a guitarist. Since that time, Brown has fronted bands, played hundreds of shows, opened for Huey Lewis, recorded albums, and journeyed across the country to Nashville to continue developing his craft of songwriting. Brown's songs are fresh but familiar and tend to move the heart as much as the head and feet. His music grabs the attention of the young and old, while being deeply rooted in timeless soul. There is an authenticity in the words and delivery that create Brown's signature sound. Brown's work ethic as an artist comes from his desire for sharing his songs with whomever will lend him an eager ear. Brown has achieved success as a solo artist and will continue leaving no stone unturned with his first Nashville record and numerous tours throughout the USA and Europe. Brown recently signed with Wally's World for college booking and Rock Ridge Music and Blue Plaid Music for management. Rock Ridge Music will be releasing Brown's first full-length album ""Walk Into The Light"" on July 22.

 Nashville based husband and wife duo Cloverdayle originally hail from the Pacific Northwest. Since the birth of Cloverdayle in 2008, Chad and Rachel Hamar have had a relentless determination to bring their brand of country music to the masses in a grassroots way. The duo moved from their home state of Oregon to Nashville, Tenn., in the fall of 2013. Not in search of fame, fortune or record deals, but with one overriding goal - to push themselves as songwriters. So they've written, and lived, and toured, and written, and lived, and toured, and written some more. Pulling from those real life experiences, Chad and Rachel have literally been writing and performing the soundtrack of their lives...and their friends' lives...and perfect strangers' lives. Cut to five years post-move, with two fully-fan-funded albums & two EPs under their collective belts, a featured song
on the popular Canadian TV show “Heartland” (now on Netflix), a feature on  's website, hundreds of
energy-fueled live performances, (including opening spots for Kenny Chesney, Lady Antebellum, Eric Church,
Jason Aldean and Kelsea Ballerini), and thousands of late nights and copious cups of early morning coffee, Cloverdayle then released a self-titled full length album featuring 15 original songs penned or co-penned by the duo, as well as a bonus track of their take on the 1996 hit “Strawberry Wine.” Their engaging live shows and regular hilarity - via Facebook and Instagram Live stream outlets - sparked the duo’s
fan base to fund their most recent Kickstarter campaign that reached almost $37,000 in just 30 days. In addition to many high-profile shows on their 2018 “Summer of Shenanigans Tour,” Cloverdayle was invited to join the line-up at the iconic Oregon Jamboree, headlining the second stage in the coveted Saturday night spot
and performing directly in front of Maren Morris and Brett Eldredge on the main stage. And Nashville is taking notice. After being pitted against prominent groups like Maddie & Tae and Runaway June, Cloverdayle wrapped up their biggest year yet by being named Women of Country’s 2018 “Group of the Year”. Born in Colorado with roots across Wyoming and settled in Oregon, it’s been a long time
coming home for Adam Larson & Co. - playing music all across the States from smoky bars,
and dance halls, to packed festivals! Larson has been writing and performing shows solo as well as with a bluegrass band
for many years. In 2016, the Company came to life, as they moved toward recording a debut
album. With the support of fans from all over the country, they recorded   This album is full of stories from a life spent working hard and on the road. ","Country, Pop",0

Filtered through the rose-tinted glasses of psychedelia and power-pop, the music weaves daring horn lines and serpentine guitar riffs through Merseybeat rockers and cheeky sambas. It's an undeniably upbeat, positively danceable affair. The band's origins can be found in Chico, CA with frontman/songwriter Maurice Spencer and his lust for snapping audiences out of their navel-gazing slumber. His background in theater and music journalism was the spring-loaded platform that propelled him from curating song compilations and theatrical composition to an impresario fronting a bonafide live  There's something rare in the grand cacophony of today's musical class: bands that provided a live  Not just a performance, not tuning for two minutes between songs, not offering excuses about why something sounded better in rehearsal the night before kind of affair, but a real   Something that people talk about afterwards; a group that melts faces, that puts on a show and that never forgets the whole purpose is to entertain so that for one short hour people could forget about their long, boring, meaningless hours working at the vape store, the karaoke bar, or the Tatertot Taco cart (which is amazing, everyone should go there...) and have an honest to goodness thing happen.  Every band needs a story. The Maurice and the Stiff Sisters story is that they put on a ripping live show. Sometimes people need to be told it's okay to fucking dance.  From their headquarters in Portland, Oregon, to their rural compound in picturesque Hockinson, Washington, Maurice and the Stiff Sisters add accelerants to the fire, smoke life to its filter and dance through the ashes.  Maurice Spencer - vocals/guitar Aaron Mattison - tenor saxophone Future Historians, Ezra Bell, PWRHAUS, The Yule Logs, Salem Symphony Orchestra ","Pop, Soul, Rock",0
